# Business Web Scraping Service

A production-ready, asynchronous web scraping and SEO analysis microservice. Built to safely render JavaScript-heavy sites, bypass basic bot protections, and extract structured business intelligence from raw web pages.

## What Does This Project Do?

At a high level, this service acts as an intelligent proxy between your applications and the public internet. Instead of downloading raw HTML, it spins up a real browser to capture exactly what a human would see.

**Core Capabilities:**
1. **Deep Rendering**: Uses headless Chromium (via Playwright) to execute JavaScript, ensuring Single Page Applications (SPAs) and dynamic content are fully loaded.
2. **Stealth Mode**: Automatically strips automated browser signatures to bypass basic bot-detection mechanisms (WAFs, Cloudflare checks).
3. **Async Orchestration**: Accepts requests instantly and processes the heavy browser rendering in a background worker queue to prevent API blocking.
4. **Insight Extraction**: Automatically parses the DOM to extract SEO signals (meta tags, open graph), counts words, maps link topology (internal vs. external links), and captures full-page screenshots.
5. **Self-Healing**: Wraps network requests in Circuit Breakers and Exponential Backoff retries. If a site temporarily drops the connection, the service waits and tries again automatically.

## Architectural Workflow

This project strictly follows **Clean Architecture (Domain-Driven Design)** principles, separated into four layers:

1. **Presentation Layer (FastAPI)**: Validates incoming HTTP requests and routes them to the application logic.
2. **Application Layer (Task Queue & Service)**: Manages the business use cases. It drops incoming URLs into a bounded in-memory queue, which a pool of async workers pull from to process.
3. **Infrastructure Layer (Playwright & Repository)**: Connects to the outside world. It manages a persistent pool of browser contexts to avoid the overhead of opening a new browser for every request.
4. **Domain Layer**: Holds the core business rules and types (`AnalysisResult`, `PageSnapshot`) with zero external dependencies.

## Usage Examples

Below are examples of how to interact with the API once it's running (`python main.py`).

### 1. Check Service Health
Verify that the service and its background workers are ready to accept traffic.
```bash
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/healthz/live
```
**Response:** `{"status": "ok", "service": "web-analyst"}`

### 2. Submit a URL for Analysis
Submit a URL. Because scraping takes time, the API immediately returns a `job_id` rather than making you wait.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/analyze \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/"}'
```

**Optional:** Wait for a specific element to load before scraping:
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/analyze \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url": "https://react.dev/", "wait_selector": ".nav-main"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "job_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f647339fadb09559aad284",
  "status": "pending",
  "poll_url": "/jobs/a1b2c3d4e5f647339fadb09559aad284"
}
```

### 3. Poll for Results
Use the `job_id` to check if your analysis is complete. You can poll this endpoint every few seconds.

```bash
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/jobs/a1b2c3d4e5f647339fadb09559aad284
```

**Successful Response (Once Completed):**
```json

  "job_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f647339fadb09559aad284",
  "url": "https://react.dev/",
